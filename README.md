ParkenDD shows you a list of the number of available public parking spots in Dresden, Germany. This information is taken indirectly from the official page at [dresden.de](http://www.dresden.de/freie-parkplaetze/).

If you're using Android have a look at the [original ParkenDD](https://github.com/jklmnn/ParkenDD) from Johannes Kliemann.

Check out [jklmnn/ParkenDD-Server](https://github.com/jklmnn/ParkenDD-Server) and [RobTranquillo/parkplaetzeDD](https://github.com/RobTranquillo/parkplaetzeDD) or [jklmnn/parkplaetzeDD](https://github.com/jklmnn/parkplaetzeDD) for the server files that scrape the official site and offer pretty JSON.
